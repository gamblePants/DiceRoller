# DiceRoller

A simple winforms program which rolls dice and then displays the output. Click on the die icon to select a die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 or d20). Then use the up-down control to determine how many of that die are thrown. Then use the up-down control to add or subtract a modifier from the final result.

In the above example 4 eight-sided dice are thrown for a total of 13, and then the modifier of 2 is added to give the final result of 15.

## Purpose

The main purpose was for me to practise some more C# using WinForms. However the program could be used as a tool for Role-Playing games (if for example, you found yourself in a situation with no real dice and wanted to simulate them). 

## How to run program

Go to the "Release" tab, download the "DiceRoller.zip" folder and extract. Inside the folder double-click on the DiceRoller.exe file
