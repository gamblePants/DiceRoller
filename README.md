# DiceRoller

A simple winforms program which rolls dice and then displays the output. Click on the die icon to select a die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 or d20). Then use the up-down control to determine how many of that die are thrown. Then use the up-down control to add or subtract a modifier from the final result.

In the above example 4 eight-sided dice are thrown for a total of 13, and then the modifier of 2 is added to give the final result of 15.
